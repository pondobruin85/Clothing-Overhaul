# Clothing Overhaul for Eco v0.10.0

Clothing and movement speed completely reworked.  

Movespeed is determined by the block you are running on and the shoes you are wearing.  For example, running shoes are great on pavement, but sub-par in dirt or gravel.  In general, boots work great in mud, sand, dirt, shoes on roads.  *Swimming appears to be changing internally by SLG, but when stable, different shoes will be affected as well*

Shirts, Pants, and hats provide a calorie reduction rate based on the temperature.  Top tier clothing within the correct climate "Cold", "temperate", or "hot", will provide 50% calorie use reduction.  It linearly reduces to 0 as you enter the wrong type of climate.  

Backpacks reworked to increase calorie consumption as well as provide weight carry capacity, in three tiers.

Belts and Gloves now provide 2 levels of max carrying capacity.

All recipes and unlock levels have been reworked.

A few hats have had recipes added.  

Bows now provide detection range reductions when equipped. 

This is very much a work in progess.  For any questions, comments, suggestions, please contact me on Eco's discord.  

***TO DO*** - update Item names and Descriptions in override files.
